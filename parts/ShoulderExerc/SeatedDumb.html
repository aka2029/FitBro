                1.	Grab a couple of dumbbells and sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.
2.	Clean the dumbbells up one at a time by using your thighs to bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height at each side.
3.	Rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position.
4.	As you exhale, push the dumbbells up until they touch at the top.
5.	After a second pause, slowly come down back to the starting position as you inhale.
6.	Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.
